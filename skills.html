                <p>
                    I have always been someone that pays attention to the little details. I like to put in my work to the smaller
                    things so it makes the larger outcome look better. I look over everything before I decide whether or not it's good 
                    enough.
                </p>

                <h3>Organization</h3>
                <img src="Images/organization.jpg" alt="Picture Of organization">
                <p>
                    I have been organized ever since I started middle school because I wanted to make sure that I kept all my papers together.
                    It helps me keep myself in order and show up early to everything that i participate in.

                <h3>Goal-Setting</h3>
                <img src="Images/goal.png" alt="Picture Of A Target">
                <P>
                    I'm a goal setter and goal achiever, I love finishing all the projects that I start. Especially when I'm at work 
                    I finish everything that I start and I finish everything before I start something new. 
                </P>

                <h3>Leadership</h3>
                <img src="Images/leadership.jpg" alt="Picture Of A Representation of Leadership">
                <p>
                    I'm very good at leading everyone and I enjoy being an authoritive figure. I like leading people to success and helping to improve 
                    their life for the best. I work hard with my teamates but still hold a strong leadership part.

                <img src="Images/medal.jpg" alt="Picture Of Medal">
                <p>
                    I have been in dance class since I was 5, I mainly practiced hip-hop and I stopped in 6th grade.
                    I wanted to be on a more competitive team but I wasn't able to because of finances.

                <h3>Excel Certified</h3>
                <img src="Images/excel.png" alt="Excel Icon">
                <p>
                    When I was a freshmen in highschool, I was given the opportunity to take the Excel Certification test, 
                    we had been working with Excel for a majority of the year so I was able to pass, being 1/3 students in my class of
                    30 that recieved this.

                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <img src="Images/coding.jpg" alt="HTML Code">
                <p>
                    I started coding in HTML in my first year of highschool, making many simplistic websites with better content 
                    opposed to format and style. In my second year of highschool, I continued by taking a Coding class which consisted of HTML and some
                    small Javascript concepts. Now in my junior year, I'm in a Coding program and have learned more elaborate HTML, now I'm making 
                    websites that could potentially be published.

                <h3>Art</h3>
                <img src="Images/art.jpg" alt="Paint">
                <p>
                    I have always been in love with art and took art classes from 1st grade till my freshmen year of highschool. 
                    I favor painting the most because there are so many things you can do with just paint. I also enjoy drawing because of all
                    the dimensions that the pictures can bring you into. I plan on taking professional art classes in college to better my art skills.
