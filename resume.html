                <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
                <p>
                    When I was a freshmen in highschool I recieved the "Rising Star" award, basically a teacher 
                    chose me as their favorite student and you recieve a star pin that you can attach to your gown 
                    at Graduation. I also recieved this award again my junior year, each teacher can only pick one student 
                    once a year so it's a big honor to have recieved these pins.

                <p>
                        When I was a sophomore in highschool I was elected historian in the Best Buddies club, it helped me get to know everyone in the club more and 
                        also helped me further my leadership skills.

                <p>
                    When I was a Junior in highschool in the West-Mec FBLA program, I was given the opportunity to be the President 
                    and I took that offer. We were a new program so I did my best to help raise all the money we could and do 
                    beneficial things for the club and the memebers.
